# @bwp-web/codegen

Turns the SOLAR design system in [`docs/`](../../docs/README.md) into code. Private to this
repository: it is a build tool, not something we publish.

One command does everything:

```bash
npm run solar:codegen
```

It reads the committed Figma data and writes two contracts — `spec/tokens.json` and
`spec/icons.json` — then emits the tokens to four targets and the icons to three. It needs no
Figma token and no network.

## The one invariant

**The generator never writes to `docs/`.** `docs/` mirrors Figma; if generated code looks wrong,
the fix belongs in this package, never in the mirror. Every write goes through
[`writeGenerated`](src/util/write.mjs), which refuses a path under `docs/` outright, and CI
re-checks it after each run. This is invariant 1 of
[the design spec](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-solar-docs-to-code-design.md).

## What it produces

`spec/tokens.json` is the contract: 710 tokens in [DTCG](https://tr.designtokens.org/) format —
647 variables, 9 shadows, 47 text styles and the 7-level z-index ladder. Modes live under
`$extensions["com.biamp.solar"].modes`. Every token target is generated from this one file.

| Target     | Output                                                 | Covers                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `css`      | `packages/styles/src/generated/css/tokens.css`         | 663 — everything except the typography composites           |
| `mui`      | `packages/styles/src/generated/mui/theme.ts`           | 710                                                         |
| `tailwind` | `packages/styles/src/generated/tailwind/preset.ts`     | 371 — the semantic layer, plus `motion.*` and font families |
| `flutter`  | `packages/solar_flutter/lib/src/generated/tokens.dart` | 710                                                         |

The four are independent emitters reading one normalized spec. They are **not** transpiled from
each other: a Dart file is not a translation of a stylesheet, and pretending otherwise is how
the two drift apart.

`spec/deviations.md` lists the **17 places the code deliberately differs from what Figma says**:
12 from the tokens, 1 from the MUI theme and 4 from the icons. It is the report SOLAR governance
reads, so every entry names an action for them. The count is whatever the data triggers, not a
list someone maintains: a rule fires only when its defect is present.

The MUI row is the one decision SOLAR does not make at all. Stock MUI components read
`palette.primary.main`, `body1`, `button` and so on, so `MUI_PALETTE` and `MUI_TYPOGRAPHY` in
[`src/emit/mui.mjs`](src/emit/mui.mjs) map those names to the SOLAR roles used the same way —
`action.*.bg` for the button fills, `surface.feedback.*.strong` for the feedback fills, display and
title for `h1`–`h6`. A name in either table that is not a token fails the build.

## How the targets are kept in agreement

Each emitter's render function returns a manifest alongside its output recording, per token,
`{emitted, normalized, modes}` — the literal it produced, that literal parsed back to a
canonical form, and the same per mode. Manifests are held in memory, never written to disk.
[`test/parity.test.mjs`](test/parity.test.mjs) asserts across all four that they agree with each
other **and** with the spec, in every mode.
Agreement alone is not enough: four targets can be uniformly wrong, so the spec is the oracle.

Two subtleties worth knowing before changing an emitter:

- **Canonicalization absorbs unit differences, not mistakes.** Alpha is quantized to 8 bits
  because Dart's `Color(0xAARRGGBB)` has only one byte for it, and letter spacing is compared as
  a fraction of the font size because Figma states it in percent, CSS needs a length and Flutter
  needs pixels. A one-step error in either still fails.
- **A manifest is a claim about the output, so parity checks it against the real artifact.** The
  last assertion re-reads the stylesheet, the MUI data and the Dart source, because an emitter
  that recorded a mode it forgot to emit would otherwise pass.

## Icons

`spec/icons.json` is the second contract, built from `docs/solar-icons/`: 341 icon sets in
outline and solid, 3 logo sets, each variant reduced to `{viewBox, paths}` and each path to its
`d` string and fill rule. Three targets are emitted from it.

| Target    | Output                                                              | Covers                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `react`   | `packages/assets/src/generated/icons/`, `.../logos/`                | 341 icon components, 2 logo components, 5 rasters |
| `svg`     | `packages/assets/src/generated/svg/`                                | 687 standalone files: 682 icon variants, 5 marks  |
| `flutter` | `packages/solar_flutter/lib/src/generated/icons.dart`, `logos.dart` | 682 icon and 4 logo `SolarVector` constants       |

The path data reaches all three byte for byte, so agreement is a property of the data rather
than of three formatters happening to concur. [`test/icon-parity.test.mjs`](test/icon-parity.test.mjs)
proves it the hard way: it opens the generated TSX, the generated SVG and the generated Dart,
extracts the geometry back out and compares it to the spec, never to a manifest.

The app icons are raster, so their bytes are not in `spec/icons.json` — only a SHA-256 of each
file. The logo emitter reads the PNG from `docs/` and refuses bytes that do not match, so a
changed image changes the spec and the spec guard sees it.

Two contracts make icons different from tokens, and each is asserted in both directions:

- **No icon carries a colour.** Every icon in SOLAR is drawn `#111111`; the normalizer asserts
  that and drops the fill, so a React path is `fill="currentColor"`, an SVG file's path is too,
  and a Dart path's `fill` is null and takes the widget's colour. The colour comes from
  `color.icon.*` at the point of use. A token's whole content is its value; an icon must have
  none, so the suite checks both the absence of any hex, `Color(` or `rgb(` and the presence of
  the inheritance that replaces it.
- **Every logo carries one.** A brand mark is not an icon with a tint, so a logo path keeps its
  own `#rrggbb`, an inherited one is an error, and `currentColor` appears in no generated logo
  artifact at all. The React and Flutter types omit a colour prop, so the compiler refuses a
  tinted mark rather than a comment asking nicely.

The one asset the vector IR cannot represent is the Teams mark — 12 gradient fills and every
`fill-opacity` in the corpus. React and the raw SVG ship it verbatim; Flutter omits it. The
emitter asserts that is the _only_ variant it skipped, and the parity suite asserts it is the
only divergence between the targets, so a second unrepresentable asset fails the build instead
of disappearing.

## Layout

```
bin/solar-codegen.mjs      the CLI: builds every stage, then emits, reports, prunes, formats
src/stages/                one module per stage (tokens, icons): build() the spec, emit() it
src/normalize/             css-contract.json -> the DTCG spec, solar-icons/ -> the icon spec,
                           the SVG reader, and the recorded deviations
src/emit/                  one file per emitter, plus the manifest entries and canonical values
src/report/                spec/deviations.md
src/util/                  paths, the docs/ write guard and pruning, sorting, naming, digests,
                           SVG markup scanning
test/                      unit suites per module, token parity across four targets, icon
                           parity across three, and the packaging checks
```

Every stage is built before any is emitted, so a normalizer that throws stops the run before a
single target has been rewritten. A new stage is a module exporting `name`, `build()` and
`emit(built)`, where `emit` returns `{counts, deviations}`, added to `STAGES` in the CLI.

**Stale output is deleted.** After every stage has written, the CLI removes anything under the
three generated directories (`packages/styles/src/generated`, `packages/assets/src/generated`,
`packages/solar_flutter/lib/src/generated`) that the run did not write, and says so. Without it,
an icon removed in Figma would keep its generated module forever, regenerating to the same bytes
and invisible to CI. Nothing outside those directories is pruned, and `spec/` is excluded on
purpose because `spec/overlay/` will hold hand-written files.

## Changing it

- **A value is wrong in every target** → the normalizer, `src/normalize/`.
- **A value is wrong in one target** → that emitter, `src/emit/`.
- **Figma itself is wrong** → add a rule to `src/normalize/deviations.mjs` so it is applied
  consistently and reported to SOLAR governance in `spec/deviations.md`. Do not edit `docs/`.
- **A new token appeared in Figma** → nothing here; re-run `npm run solar:tokens`, and the
  normalizer picks it up. An unknown token _type_ fails loudly rather than guessing.
- **A new icon appeared in Figma** → nothing here either; re-run `npm run solar:icons`, and
  `src/normalize/icons.mjs` picks it up. An SVG feature the IR cannot represent — a gradient, a
  stroke, an arc — fails naming the file rather than being quietly dropped.

Everything generated is committed, and CI regenerates it and fails on any difference, so run
`npm run solar:codegen` and commit the result after touching this package.

Generator code is ESM `.mjs` with no build step. Run the suites with `npx vitest run` from here
or from the repository root.
